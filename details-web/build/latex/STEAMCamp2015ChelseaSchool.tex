\chapter{Overview}
\label{description:steam-camp-2015}\label{description:overview}\label{description::doc}

\section{Summary}
\label{description:summary}
Through hands-on computing, Chelsea School's STEAM \footnote{
Science, Technology, Arts, Engineering, and Math

In the context of this program, STEM and STEAM are used interchangeably. We feel strongly that STEM education, as it is traditionally defined, must integrate critical reading, interpretation, and critique of the arts. We note, however, that Maryland State Department of Education gives this some consideration. STEM education programs, however, do not include humanities or the arts (\href{http://www.livescience.com/43296-what-is-stem-education.html}{livescience.com} offers a fairly representative definition).
} Camp provides day-long, hands-on instruction in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, \& the arts for students in 4th through 12th grades.

From July 17th through the 24th, 2015, our weekdays begin with learning fundamental programming concepts by programming tools with an innovative, visual programming language from MIT.

Following that joint session, participants may choose between game design \& development or information security \& forensics.

In the afternoon, participants will come together to study relationships between the culture, the arts, \& innovative technologies.

Connected Learning \footnote{
Connected learning is an approach to addressing inequity in education in ways geared to a networked society. It seeks to leverage the potential of digital media to expand access to learning that is socially embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political opportunity. Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement. This model is based on evidence that the most resilient, adaptive, and effective learning involves individual interest as well as social support to overcome adversity and provide recognition (Ito). The approach knits together three crucial contexts for learning: interest-powered; peer-supported; academically oriented. In addition, it embraces these key design principles: production-centered; open networks; shared purpose.

\label{philosophy:rational}\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
For every job posting for a bachelor's degree recipient in a non-STEM field there were 5 entry level postings for a bachelor's degree recipient in a STEM field. (\href{http://www.stemconnector.org/sites/default/files/store/STEM-Students-STEM-Jobs-Executive-Summary.pdf}{STEMConnector})

\item {} 
By 2018, the very significant bulk of STEM careers will be in the field of computing: 71\% (traditional engineering is second at 16\%. (\href{http://www.stemconnector.org/sites/default/files/store/STEM-Students-STEM-Jobs-Executive-Summary.pdf}{STEMConnector})

\item {} 
Only 10\% of students in the United States receive credits for computing related courses in elementary, primary, or secondary school courses. (Code.org)

\item {} 
Computing careers offer very broad variety of entry-level position requirements, allowing for significant personal preference when commiting to a post-secondary path.

\chapter{Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Program}
\label{cybersecurity::doc}\label{cybersecurity:cybersecurity-and-digital-forensics-program}

\section{Description}
\label{cybersecurity:description}
The \emph{Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics} course is a component of a two-week summer program at Chelsea School in Hyattsville, Maryland, for middle and secondary-school students who are interested in the growing field of cybersecurity \footnote{
In the context of this course, cybersecurity, infosec, security, network security, and information security are used interchangeably. Note too that the scope of study is limited to PC-based Microsoft and Linux-linux based systems. We do not attempt to cram mobile forensics or Macintosh server security into the program.
}.

This ten-day experience provides hands-on activities focused on computing and cybersecurity topics. Attendees will learn and apply basic concepts of programming, computer forensics, cryptography, steganography, system vulnerabilities and program management from a series of gaming and simulation activities and hands-on exercises.


\section{Goal}
\label{cybersecurity:goal}
To allow secondary students to explore and apply various topics within cybersecurity fields by linking research to practice through hands-on experience.


\section{Learning Outcomes}

\section{Hours}

\section{Topics \footnote{
A realistic plan is in place to address these topics to an appropriate degree, with time left for red-teaming and hands-on learning. As we get a snapshot of enrollment, the emphases with shift, and the delivery of content will be adjusted to meet the individual needs of participants.

\section{What is STEM Education? What then is STEAM education?}
\label{faq:what-is-stem-education-what-then-is-steam-education}
This curriculum seeks to merge the boundaries of science, technology engineering and math (STEM), while explicitly integrating these subjects with arts and the humanities.

Maryland State Department of Education gives this some consideration in its \emph{Maryland State STEM Standards of Practice Framework} \footnote{
From \href{http://mdk12.org/instruction/academies/MDSTEM\_Framework\_Grades6-12.pdf}{Maryland State STEM Standards of Practice Framework} (2012):

STEM education is an approach to teaching and learning that integrates the content and skills of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. STEM Standards of Practice guide STEM instruction by defining the combination of behaviors, integrated with STEM content, which are expected of a proficient STEM student. These behaviors include engagement in inquiry, logical reasoning, collaboration, and investigation. The goal of STEM education is to prepare students for post-secondary study and the 21st century workforce.

STEM education removes the artificial barriers that isolate content and allows for an integrated instructional approach. The curriculum should allow students to develop life skills and apply content knowledge within a real world context. STEM education is active and focuses on a student-centered learning environment. Students engage in questioning, problem solving,collaboration, and hands-on activities while they address real life issues. In STEM education, teachers function as classroom facilitators. They guide students through the problem-solving process and plan projects that lead to mastery of content and STEM proficiency. STEM proficient students are able to answer complex questions, investigate global issues, and develop solutions for challenges and real world problems while applying the rigor of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics content in a seamless fashion. STEM proficient students are logical thinkers, effective communicators and are technologically,scientifically, and mathematically literate. (4)

There are two goals for STEM education in \emph{high school}. The first goal is on the development of STEM proficient students. All students will continue to grow in their STEM proficiency as they progress from grades 9-12. Students demonstrate independence and become more focused and sophisticated in their approach to answering complex questions, investigating global issues, and developing solutions for challenges and real world problems. STEM proficient students graduate with the basic skills and knowledge required to pursue post-secondary study or work in any field.

The second goal for STEM education in high school is on the advanced preparation of students for post-secondary study and careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. High school provides a unique opportunity for students to explore different career paths and college majors through advanced coursework, career academies, magnet programs, STEM academies, specialized STEM programs, internships, and dual enrollment opportunities. Specific programs to address the needs for advanced preparation of students shall be determine by individual schools systems. (5)

However, we feel strongly that
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Computing is a core literacy

\item {} 
The ability to read, interpret, and critique cultural productions is a necessary condition of digital literacy and computing.

\end{enumerate}

Therefore, we have worked toward adopting the acronym \emph{STEAM} and the phrases \emph{STEAM Education} and \emph{STEAM Camp}.
