Programming Fundamentals
=======================================================


Summary
=======

This game-based introduction to the logic underlying software engineering focuses on coding fundamentals using visual & text-based interpreted languages & their syntaxes, while preparing participants for either our game design or cybersecurity & digital forensics sessions.

Students will first be exposed to programming by creating games with Scratch, a visual language developed at MIT.

Students who demonstrate mastery of the concepts introduced with Scratch will move toward programming in a high-level, interpreted, text-based language, such as Python and Ruby.

Interested students will also be introduced to shell programming with bash.

Learning Objectives
=====================

The participant will:

* Demonstrate an understanding of **variables** and **value types**

* Store and recall related data in and from an **array**

* Differentiate between **compiled** and **interpreted** programming languages

* Articulate the difference between **high and low-level programming languages**

* Make appropriate use of **loops** (for, while)

* Rely effectivly on **conditionals** and nested conditionals to determine the behavior of a program or script

* Manage source code with a **source-code management** tool, such as git

* Practice **pair programming** in the interest of efficiency, precision, accuracy, and collaboration

* **Navigate the filesystem** on at least two operating systems from graphical and command-line interfaces

* Declare **constants** effectively and appropriately

* Rely on **functions** to reduce redundancy and discourage errors

* Write accurate and precise **documentation**

* Write **code comments** and demonstrate best-practice commenting

* Articulate categories of applications to support the development process

* Create a custom **development environment** based on careful deliberation and reflection on the development process

* Research, download, use existing language libraries where appropriate

.. sidebar:: Contingency

  Come to a fundamental understanding of **objects**, **methods**, and **classes** depending on language, instructional time, student preferences
