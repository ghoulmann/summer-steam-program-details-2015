===========================================
Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Program
===========================================

Description
===========

The *Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics* course is a component of a two-week summer program at Chelsea School in Hyattsville, Maryland, for middle and secondary-school students who are interested in the growing field of cybersecurity[1]_. 

This ten-day experience provides hands-on activities focused on computing and cybersecurity topics. Attendees will learn and apply basic concepts of programming, computer forensics, cryptography, steganography, system vulnerabilities and program management from a series of gaming and simulation activities and hands-on exercises.

.. [1] In the context of this course, cybersecurity, infosec, security, network security, and information security are used interchangeably. Note too that the scope of study is limited to PC-based Microsoft and Linux-linux based systems. We do not attempt to cram mobile forensics or Macintosh server security into the program.
