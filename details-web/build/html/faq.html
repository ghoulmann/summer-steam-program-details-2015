<h2>What is Chelsea School?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-chelsea-school" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://chelseaschool.edu">Chelsea School</a> is a non-profit, non-public school for students with learning differences.</p>
<p>Chelsea School is located in <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseaschool.edu/about/directions">Hyattsville, MD</a>, and serves students from the DC Metro Area.</p>
<p>Chelsea <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseaschool.edu/about/bios#students">students</a> are middle school and high school students (grades 5-12) with language-based <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseaschool.edu/about/LD">learning differences</a> and ADHD.</p>
<p>Chelsea <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseaschool.edu/about/bios">faculty and staff</a> includes dedicated teachers who are certified in special education and/or their specific content area.</p>
<p>The Chelsea School <a class="reference external" href="http://chelseaschool.edu/academics">curriculum</a> is designed to prepare students for the rigors of college-level courses and includes small group instruction, strategic remediation, and access to speech-language therapy, occupational therapy and counseling.

<h2>What is STEM Education? What then is STEAM education?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-stem-education-what-then-is-steam-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This curriculum seeks to merge the boundaries of science, technology engineering and math (STEM), while explicitly integrating these subjects with arts and the humanities.</p>
<p>Maryland State Department of Education gives this some consideration in its <em>Maryland State STEM Standards of Practice Framework</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>However, we feel strongly that</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Computing is a core literacy</li>
<li>The ability to read, interpret, and critique cultural productions is a necessary condition of digital literacy and computing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, we have worked toward adopting the acronym <em>STEAM</em> and the phrases <em>STEAM Education</em> and <em>STEAM Summer Program</em>.</p>

<p>Engage in substantive discussion and enquiry about each day&#8217;s content; provide an opportunity and support (perhaps working as a pair) for independent enquiry and practice after each day&#8217;s programs conclude.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-resources-do-participants-need">

<p>All content materials, including e-texts, opportunities to screen films and videos; materials for arts and crafting; Windows 7 and GNU/Linux workstations. For the protection of the population, internet content filters are in place; when legitimate content is incidentally or mistakenly filtered, we will act quickly to make it available.</p>
<p>In addition, participants will receive one USB drive containing course content and recommended software. Each participant will receive a second USB drive containing a live operating system (allows participants to explore alternative operating systems or functional toolkits without effecting home computers in any way).</p>

<p>Ideal conditions include home access to an Intel i5 or AMD equivalent PC with 4-8 GB RAM and the ability to boot from USB drives; unfettered access to the Internet; a reading partner or guide; curiosity and the courage to pursue independent research related to program content.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-homework-assigned">

<p>Our first recommendation is to look into the &#8220;Recommended Reading and Viewing&#8221; and looking into texts that provoke interest. Our second recommendation is to keep a reading log of texts, videos, and webpages that are read or scanned in anticipation of this summer program.</p>
<p>We encourage eager participants to introduce themselves and ask for suggested starting points based on their interests and program paths: Initiate contact with the <a class="reference external" href="https://secure.jotformpro.com/form/43524617695968">contact form</a> at <a class="reference external" href="https://secure.jotformpro.com/form/43524617695968">https://secure.jotformpro.com/form/43524617695968</a>.</p>

<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td><p class="first">From <a class="reference external" href="http://mdk12.org/instruction/academies/MDSTEM_Framework_Grades6-12.pdf">Maryland State STEM Standards of Practice Framework</a> (2012):</p>
<p>STEM education is an approach to teaching and learning that integrates the content and skills of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. STEM Standards of Practice guide STEM instruction by defining the combination of behaviors, integrated with STEM content, which are expected of a proficient STEM student. These behaviors include engagement in inquiry, logical reasoning, collaboration, and investigation. The goal of STEM education is to prepare students for post-secondary study and the 21st century workforce.</p>
<p>STEM education removes the artificial barriers that isolate content and allows for an integrated instructional approach. The curriculum should allow students to develop life skills and apply content knowledge within a real world context. STEM education is active and focuses on a student-centered learning environment. Students engage in questioning, problem solving,collaboration, and hands-on activities while they address real life issues. In STEM education, teachers function as classroom facilitators. They guide students through the problem-solving process and plan projects that lead to mastery of content and STEM proficiency. STEM proficient students are able to answer complex questions, investigate global issues, and develop solutions for challenges and real world problems while applying the rigor of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics content in a seamless fashion. STEM proficient students are logical thinkers, effective communicators and are technologically,scientifically, and mathematically literate. (4)</p>
<p>There are two goals for STEM education in <em>high school</em>. The first goal is on the development of STEM proficient students. All students will continue to grow in their STEM proficiency as they progress from grades 9-12. Students demonstrate independence and become more focused and sophisticated in their approach to answering complex questions, investigating global issues, and developing solutions for challenges and real world problems. STEM proficient students graduate with the basic skills and knowledge required to pursue post-secondary study or work in any field.</p>
<p class="last">The second goal for STEM education in high school is on the advanced preparation of students for post-secondary study and careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. High school provides a unique opportunity for students to explore different career paths and college majors through advanced coursework, career academies, magnet programs, STEM academies, specialized STEM programs, internships, and dual enrollment opportunities. Specific programs to address the needs for advanced preparation of students shall be determine by individual schools systems. (5)</p>
