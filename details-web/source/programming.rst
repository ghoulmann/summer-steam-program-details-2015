=======================================================
Programming Fundamentals...Program *under development*
=======================================================


Summary
=======

This game-based introduction to the logic underlying software engineering focuses on coding fundamentals using visual & text-based interpreted languages & their syntaxes & prepares participants for either our game design or cybersecurity & digital forensics sessions. Students will first be exposed to programming by creating games with Scratch, a visual language developed at MIT. Students who demonstrate mastery of the concepts introduced with Scratch will move toward programming in a high-level, interpreted, text-based language, such as Python and Ruby. Interested students will also be introduced to shell programming with bash.

Learning Objectives
=====================

The participant will:

* Demonstrate an understanding variables and variable types
* Store and recall related data in and from an array
* Differentiate between compiled and interpreted programming languages
* Articulate the difference between high and low-level programming languages
* Make appropriate use of a variety of loops
* Rely effectivly on conditionals and nested conditionals to determine the behavior of a program or script
* Manage source code with a source-code management tool, such as git
* Practice pair programming in the interest of efficiency, precision, accuracy, and collaboration
* Navigate the filesystem on at least two operating systems from a graphical and command line interface
* Declare constants effectively and appropriately
* Rely on functions to reduce redundancy and discourage errors
