===================================
Overview
===================================

Summary
=======

Through hands-on computing, Chelsea School's STEAM [1]_ Summer Program provides day-long, hands-on instruction in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, & the arts for students in 4th through 12th grades.

From July 13th through the 24th, 2015, our weekdays begin at 9:00 AM with a study of relationships between culture, the arts, & innovative technologies.

Following that joint session, participants may *choose* between **Game Design & Development** *or* **Information Security & Forensics**.

For the remainder of the day, participants will come together for learning fundamental programming concepts by programming tools with an innovative, visual programming language from MIT; our days will end at 4:30 PM.

Features
==========

Metro Accessible
----------------

Our campus is conveniently located across the street from the Prince George's Metro stop.

State of the Art Facilities
---------------------------

Our new, state-of-the-art facility features interactive whiteboards; gigabit ethernet; & over 100 student workstations equipped for equitable access to appropriate assistive and instructional technologies.

Research-based Instruction
---------------------------

Grounded in `Chelsea School's philosophy, mission, and values <http://chelseaschool.edu/about/>`_, and supported by highly experienced instructors and technologists, participants will receive *individualized* instruction; they will practice reading across the curriculum; and  will take part in post-secondary exploration & preparation.

Curriculum Overview
=====================

Programming Concepts
------------------------

This game-based introduction to the logic underlying software engineering focuses on coding fundamentals using visual & text-based interpreted languages & their syntaxes; in addition, this session prepares participants for either our **Game Design and Development** or **Information Security & Digital Forensics** sessions.

Game Design & Development
-------------------------

Participants will have hands-on experience building a game in professional game development engines. Using 3D models & code produced in C# & Javascript, they will assemble the terrain, objects & other elements of the game, capture input from users & script game physics & AI behavior.
 
Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics
---------------------------------

Attendees will learn & apply basic concepts of programming, computer forensics, cryptography, steganography, system vulnerability assessment, & project management from a series of gaming & simulation activities & hands-on exercises.

Arts & Technology
---------------------------

Participants will explore the role of arts & creativity in technology, including the ways in which literature, visual arts, & music influence — and are influenced by — science & technology. Participants will engage in hands-on projects including creative writing workshops, crafts & more.

Daily Schedule
==============

Weekdays

.. [1] Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math

    In the context of this program, STEM and STEAM are used interchangeably. We feel strongly that STEM education, as it is traditionally defined, must integrate critical reading, interpretation, and critique of the arts. We note, however, that Maryland State Department of Education gives this `some consideration <faq.html#what-is-stem-education-what-then-is-steam-education>`_. STEM education programs, however, do not include humanities or the arts (`livescience.com <http://www.livescience.com/43296-what-is-stem-education.html>`_ offers a fairly representative definition).
