:title: STEM Camp: In Brief
:author: Rik Goldman, Chelsea School

===================================
Overview
===================================

Summary
=======

Through hands-on computing, Chelsea School's STEAM [1]_ Camp provides day-long, hands-on instruction in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, & the arts for students in 4th through 12th grades.

From July 17th through the 24th, 2015, our weekdays begin with a study of relationships between the culture, the arts, & innovative technologies.

Following that joint session, participants may *choose* between game design & development *or* information security & forensics.

In the afternoon, participants will come together for learning fundamental programming concepts by programming tools with an innovative, visual programming language from MIT.

State of the Art Facilities
---------------------------

Our new, state-of-the-art facility features interactive whiteboards; gigabit ethernet; & over 100 student workstations equipped for equitable access to appropriate assistive technology.

Research-based Instruction
---------------------------

Grounded in `Chelsea School's philosophy <http://chelseaschool.edu/about/>`_, participants will receive individualized instruction; reading across the curriculum; & post-secondary exploration & preparation from highly experienced instructors & technologists.

Curriculum Overview
===================

Programming Concepts
------------------------

This game-based introduction to the logic underlying software engineering focuses on coding fundamentals using visual & text-based interpreted languages & their syntaxes & prepares participants for either our game design or cybersecurity & digital forensics sessions.

Game Design & Development
-------------------------

Participants will have hands-on experience building a game in professional game development engines. Using 3D models & code produced in C# & Javascript, they will assemble the terrain, objects & other elements of the game, capture input from users & script game physics & AI behavior.
 
Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics
---------------------------------

Attendees will learn & apply basic concepts of programming, computer forensics, cryptography, steganography, system vulnerability assessment, & project management from a series of gaming & simulation activities & hands-on exercises.

Arts & Technology
---------------------------

Participants will explore the role of arts & creativity in technology — including the ways in which literature, visual arts, & music influence — & are influenced by — science & technology. Participants will engage in hands-on projects including writing workshops, crafts & more.

Daily Schedule
==============

Weekdays

* Arts and Technology
* Break
* Independent Projects

* Programming Fundamentals
* Breakout Session: Game Design **or** Infosec and Forensics


Notes

.. [1] Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math

    In the context of this program, STEM and STEAM are used interchangeably. We feel strongly that STEM education, as it is traditionally defined, must integrate critical reading, interpretation, and critique of the arts. We note, however, that Maryland State Department of Education gives this `some consideration <faq.html#what-is-stem-education-what-then-is-steam-education>`_. STEM education programs, however, do not include humanities or the arts (`livescience.com <http://www.livescience.com/43296-what-is-stem-education.html>`_ offers a fairly representative definition).
