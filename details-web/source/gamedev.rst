========================================
Game Design and App Development Program
========================================

Description
===============

Participants will be given the opportunity to design/mod their own games using the *Unity 4* game development platform. At the end of the course, students will have gained hands-on experience building a game using modern game-creation software that can be deployed as a mobile app or web-based game. 

Using 3D models and code produced in C# and Javascript, participants will assemble the terrain, objects and other elements of the game, capture input from users, and script game physics and AI behavior.

Goal
===========

Our goal for this course is to familiarize secondary-school students with the basics of game design/development from the planning stage to final product. The course will provide participants with a framework in which to experiment with the practical application of programming basics, an opportunity to learn how apps are developed and released, and the resources, encouragement, and opportunity to create in the medium of interactive narrative.
