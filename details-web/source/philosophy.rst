[draft in progress]

* For every job posting for a bachelor's degree recipient in a non-STEM field there were 5 entry level postings for a bachelor's degree recipient in a STEM field. (`STEMConnector <http://www.stemconnector.org/sites/default/files/store/STEM-Students-STEM-Jobs-Executive-Summary.pdf>`_)
* By 2018, the very significant bulk of STEM careers will be in the field of computing: 71% (traditional engineering is second at 16%. (`STEMConnector <http://www.stemconnector.org/sites/default/files/store/STEM-Students-STEM-Jobs-Executive-Summary.pdf>`_)
* Only 10% of students in the United States receive credits for computing related courses in elementary, primary, or secondary school courses. (Code.org)
* Computing careers offer very broad variety of entry-level position requirements, allowing for significant personal preference when commiting to a post-secondary path.

Critical Considerations
-----------------------

* Underrepresentation of women in STEM fields
* Equitable Access to resources
* Participants include reluctant readers and writers
* Participants benefit from indivualized instruction well-suited to their learning styles and preferences.

.. [1] Connected learning is an approach to addressing inequity in education in ways geared to a networked society. It seeks to leverage the potential of digital media to expand access to learning that is socially embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political opportunity. Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement. This model is based on evidence that the most resilient, adaptive, and effective learning involves individual interest as well as social support to overcome adversity and provide recognition (Ito).  The approach knits together three crucial contexts for learning: interest-powered; peer-supported; academically oriented. In addition, it embraces these key design principles: production-centered; open networks; shared purpose.
