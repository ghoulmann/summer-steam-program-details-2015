Participant Expression
====================================


*This section describes participants’ rights and responsibilities regarding participant expression. It also describes policies and procedures regarding appropriate and inappropriate speech, distribution of literature, assemble and petition, symbolic
expression and physical appearance.*

All participants have the individual right to communicate their ideas on various issues. In the interest of all individuals and in the interest of the education process, participant expression may not infringe upon the guaranteed rights of others.

**Right**:

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits laws “abridging the freedom of speech or the press” and guarantees “the rights of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” The protections of the First Amendment apply to the Chelsea Program.

----------------------------

* Participants shall recognize that expression must not infringe upon the rights of others nor disrupt classroom or program procedures

* Participants shall recognize the rights of others to have individual views which may differ from their own

* Participants shall be responsible for controlling their conduct in order to avoid disruption of the education process

* Participants’ physical appearance should not disrupt nor contradict the Chelsea Program dress code policy

Regulations
------------

1. Disruptive Speech and Activities – Certain types of speech and behavior are considered so disruptive that they may be prohibited outright. Ed. Art, 26-101. The willful disturbance of program activities or other actions that prevent the orderly
conduct of educational functions are forbidden. Similarly, persons may not threaten with bodily harm nor otherwise molest individuals in the immediate vicinity of the Chelsea Program, 26-101(b). The free speech right that participants have in
the program environment is governed by a rule of reason applied to specific facts.

2. Distribution of Literature – Written communication by participants in program-sponsored publications is subject to the reasonable restrictions of program officials so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical
concerns. (Hazelwood Program District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S.

3. Assembly and Petition – The First Amendment provides participants with the fundamental right to assemble and to circulate petitions; however, the Head of Program may, at his discretion, restrict the use of program facilities for group
activities.

Programs may set reasonable limits as to the time, place, and manner in which participants and participant groups may assemble, *as long as those restrictions advance legitimate educational goals* (Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 (1968)).

Participant Disciplinary Action
============================================

Introduction
-------------

This section describes participants’ rights and responsibilities
concerning discipline. It also describes policies and procedures
regarding behaviors which detract from the orderly and safe
operation of the program and outlines types of disciplinary
action which will be taken when behavior is in violation of an
established policy.

Disciplinary Policy
-----------------------

The Chelsea Program recognizes the need to ensure that the
program environment is safe for both participants and adults,
and conducive to teaching and learning. Discipline is intended
to foster responsibility and encourage appropriate behavior on
the part of those participants whose actions or presence in
program disrupt its administration or represent a danger to
themselves or others.

The Chelsea Program recognizes that participant behavior is the
shared responsibility of the program, the participant and the
participant’s parent/guardian. Using the Chelsea Program Code
of Conduct and Course of Disciplinary Action, program personnel
are responsible for taking appropriate action when a
participant’s actions or presence in program is not conducive
to a safe and orderly environment. The participant has the right
to be informed of the reasons for disciplinary action.

Definitions
------------

* *Warning* – may be oral or written for minor offenses.

* *Expulsion* – the removal of a participant from program permanently, as determined by the Head of Program and Assistant Head of Program.

* *Exclusion* – allows the participant the opportunity to de-escalate in a supervised area for a limited time period (30 minutes), where the participant has the opportunity to refocus on curriculum of instruction while at the Chelsea Program and/or regain self-control.

In cases of expulsion, parents will be notified by telephone immediately and a letter will be written and sent home within 24 hours of the incident.

Search and Seizure
==============================

Introduction
-------------

This section describes participants’ rights and responsibilities
regarding search and seizure. It also describes policies and
procedures for searches by program officials, searches by the
police and arrest and questioning of participants.

**Right**:

The environment in the Chelsea Program should be safe and
orderly. Participants are protected against unreasonable search
and seizure by program officials by the Fourth Amendment.
However, program officials do not need a warrant to conduct a
search of a participant, and the level of suspicion required to
justify a search is no “probable cause” as it is in most
circumstances, but rather a standard of “reasonable belief.”
Both the inception of the search and its scope must be
justified by this standard, and the privacy interests of the
participants may be invaded “no more than is necessary to
achieve the legitimate end of preserving order in the program.”

Participant Responsibilities
----------------------------

* Participants have the responsibility not to bring lethal or dangerous substances into program

* Participants have the responsibility not to bring weapons into program

* Participants have the responsibility to obey all State and Federal laws

* Participants have the responsibility to cooperate with program officials who conduct reasonable searches and seizures under the guidelines established by State and Federal law

* Participants have the responsibility to cooperate with police officers engaged in searches and seizures, questioning, and arrests on program premises under the guidelines established by State and Federal laws

Chelsea Program: P.R.I.D.E. (Personal Responsibility and Individual Dedication to Excellence)
===============================================================================================================================================================

Daily Rules and Procedures Summary
-----------------------------------

The philosophy of Chelsea Program is to maximize the academic
and social potential of each of our participants. In providing
a professional faculty and staff that dedicates itself to
teaching our bright participants who learn differently, it is
our goal that they will achieve all the benefits of our
individual program. To this end, all rules and regulations
regarding learning and program behavior will be thoroughly
explained to the participants with fairness and consistency.
Disciplining our participants at Chelsea Program requires a
positive, caring and prudent effort by administration,
participants, advisors and parents. Discipline is the means of
experiencing the pain of problems we have created in a
constructive way and in an effort to learn from these problems.

The goals of program discipline are:

* For all participants to feel cared for, safe, and secure in their program community.

* To teach participants the natural and logical consequences of their actions.

Guidelines of discipline are provided so that participants will
know the standards to which they are held. Understanding the
rules gives participants the tools to maximize their potential
both as participants and as good citizens in the community at
large. Through this understanding, they will learn to do their
best and they will understand the consequences of their
behavior.

At Chelsea Program, participants will be required to follow all
program rules put forth in the Participant/Parent handbook,
also including three major rules:

1. There is to be no:

    * Verbal Abuse: Anything that is said to hurt another on the inside is prohibited.

    * Physical Abuse: Any action that hurts another on the outside is prohibited.

    * Destruction of Property: Action that wrongly destroys property is prohibited.

2. Participants must follow The Honor Code: No lying, cheating, or stealing.

3. The use of drugs, alcohol, or other controlled substances will not be tolerated at any time, on or off campus.

4. Bringing a weapon to program will result in the program’s recommendation of expulsion.

If any of the rules is broken, there will be immediate
consequences up to and including expulsion. Consequences will
be fair and equitable for all participants at Chelsea Program.
Participants who fail to complete the program due to a
disciplinary expulsion will not be subject to a refund of the
program cost.
